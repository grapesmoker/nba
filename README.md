Tools for collecting NBA play-by-play data from the Web and analyzing it.

The nba-2013-14.py script contains functions for collecting NBA play-by-play data from the Web. It uses MongoDB to store player, team, and play-by-play information and computes various statistics for players and teams from this data. Currently included is the ability to generate shot charts; eventually the goal is to use scikit-learn to do things like predict matchup margins and such.
